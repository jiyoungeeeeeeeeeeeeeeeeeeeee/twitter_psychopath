# twitter_psychopath

📌 Project Overview
This project explores the Twitter Psychopathy Prediction Dataset.
Although it’s a relatively unexplored dataset, I am working on building an end‑to‑end MLOps pipeline for training, evaluation, and deployment.

🚀 Current Progress
✅ Rebuilt the dataset files after path issues
✅ Improved model performance — R² score improved from 0.35 → 0.40 (a significant jump)
✅ MLOps environment under active development

For now, the project is on hold while I focus on preparing for a certification exam.
Development will resume afterward, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions in the meantime!

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python (pandas, scikit‑learn, LightGBM, XGBoost)

MLOps Tools: Apache Airflow, MLflow, Docker (planned)

Experiment Tracking: MLflow

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Environment: Ubuntu, Virtualenv

📈 Roadmap
 Data preprocessing and initial modeling

 Improve baseline model (R² from 0.35 → 0.40)

 Build a basic MLOps pipeline with Airflow

 Integrate MLflow for full experiment tracking

 Containerize the pipeline with Docker

 Deploy and monitor the model in a production‑like environment

 Explore advanced feature engineering and model stacking

🔮 Future Plans
Refine feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to push the R² score higher

Automate retraining and evaluation pipelines

Add monitoring (drift detection, data quality checks)

Share insights and write detailed blog posts or tutorials

Open to collaboration — feel free to reach out if interested!

💡 Any advice, feedback, or collaboration is always welcome.
Since this dataset isn’t widely used, it sometimes feels like a lonely battle — but I believe there’s a lot of potential to explore together. ✨
