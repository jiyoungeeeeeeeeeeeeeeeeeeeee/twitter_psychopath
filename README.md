## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the [Twitter Psychopathy Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/twitter-psychopathy-prediction).  
Although it’s a relatively unexplored dataset, I am working on building an end‑to‑end **MLOps pipeline** for training, evaluation, and deployment.  

---

## 🚀 Current Progress  
✅ Rebuilt the dataset files after path issues  
✅ Improved model performance — **R² score improved from 0.35 → 0.40** (a significant jump)  
✅ MLOps environment under active development  

> For now, the project is **on hold** while I focus on preparing for a certification exam.  
> Development will resume afterward, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions in the meantime!

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python (pandas, scikit‑learn, LightGBM, XGBoost)  
- **MLOps Tools:** Apache Airflow, MLflow, Docker (planned)  
- **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  
- **Environment:** Ubuntu, Virtualenv  

---

## 📈 Roadmap  
- [x] Data preprocessing and initial modeling  
- [x] Improve baseline model (R² from 0.35 → 0.40)  
- [x] Build a basic MLOps pipeline with Airflow  
- [ ] Integrate MLflow for full experiment tracking  
- [ ] Containerize the pipeline with Docker  
- [ ] Deploy and monitor the model in a production‑like environment  
- [ ] Explore advanced feature engineering and model stacking  

---

## 🔮 Future Plans  
- Refine feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to push the R² score higher  
- Automate retraining and evaluation pipelines  
- Add monitoring (drift detection, data quality checks)  
- Open to collaboration — feel free to reach out if interested!

💡 **Any advice, feedback, or collaboration is always welcome.**  
Since this dataset isn’t widely used, it sometimes feels like a lonely battle — but I believe there’s a lot of potential to explore together. ✨
